# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

The objective of this project is to assist an organization in improving employee performance and improve employee retention and attrition through data-driven insights. This endeavor is supported by the implementation of an HR analytics dashboard, strategically structured through three distinctive filters: Human Resources, Research and Development, and sales. To accurately measure an employee's performance and retention, I have utilized several key performance indicators(KPIs)such as overall employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, average age of employees,active employees in the company .

**The project followed the following procedure:**

**Data Extraction:** The data was provided in Excel format from        the client.
 
**Transform data:** Load the data in Power BI and further, the data was cleaned by removing null values and duplicate values, rectifying spelling errors and data types in Power query. 

**Load data:** The transform data was loaded into power view for further analysis. 

**Data modeling:** A logical structure was created for the data through the data modeling process, enabling effective analysis and visualization. 

**Writing DAX:** The data was further refined using the Data Analysis Expression(DAX)language to create calculated measures and calculated columns for advanced analysis.

**Report Building:** Intuitive and user-friendly reports and visualizations were created to build the dashboard.

**Dashboard Template:** I have created dashboard template using figma

**Insights:**

■ Maximum attrition happens in Life Sciences Education i.e. 38% and Laboratory Technician as job role i.e. 62.

■ Overall 237 employees have left the company out of which 150 are males and 81 are females.

■ Maximum attrition happening in the age group 26-35.

■ Attrition is directly proportional to job satisfaction as well for different job roles. Hence lower the number, the more chances of attrition.a
